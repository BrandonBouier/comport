          Each complaint may contain multiple allegations, such as rudeness and inappropriate language. Each allegation is ruled on separately. There are four possible rulings:
          Sustained means that the investigation agreed with the allegation in the complaint. When allegations are sustained, the Chief of Police will take the appropriate disciplinary action.
          Not sustained means that the investigation did not find evidence to prove or disprove the complaint. If allegations are found to be not sustained, the officer's name is submitted to IMPD's Early Warning system.
          Exonerated means the incident happened, but it was lawful and proper.
          Unfounded means that the incident happened, however not as detailed in the complaint.
          Complaints that are still being investigated will be blank in this column.</td>
